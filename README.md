# Longitudinal data Grafset 
t1 (start first grade), t2 (end first grade), t3 (start second grade)
## Research questions: 
- Can handwriting consistency at t1 predict handwriting productivity and spelling at t3?
- Can name writing processes at t1 predict handwriting productivity and spelling at t3?

## DTW (handwriting consistency)
## Hund (handwriting productivity)
### Hund processes (CSWin)
### Hund product (number of words/letters)
## HSP (spelling)
## EF data
## child and background variables
